# Malware_Classification
Malware Classification with CoAtNet: Marrying Convolution and Attention for Visual Images pytorch.

The increasing threat of malicious software has pushed malware detection
into the realm of convolutional neural networks and deep learning. In this
paper we will look at some of the machine learning methods already applied
to malware detection and utilise a recently proposed method for visual
classification in the field of malware detection called CoAtNet. We will
also look at malware detection with convolutional neural networks with and
without data augmentation.
